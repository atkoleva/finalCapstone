## Installation <br/>

Running the notebook requires a [Python Environment (v.3.10)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) which has the [Jupyter Package (v.1.0.0.)](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/) installed. Please refer to the links provided for information on how to install these packages to your system.

In addition, the following Python modules are required:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy
- sklearn

To install the modules on Windows 10 OS, open the Command Prompt and run 'pip3 install {module_name}'. For example:
> 'pip3 install pandas'
For more information on how to install Python modules, please refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3.10/installing/index.html).

## Usage <br/>

This repository contains two files: a Jupyter notebook (T51_unsupervised-learning.ipynb) and a CSV (UsArrests.csv) containing a dataset referenced by the notebook.

The notebook contains code which performs supervised learning methods on the dataset and generates accompanying reports. Methods include:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering
- K-Means Clustering

The notebook produces informative and graphical outputs which are accompanied by author commentary (markdown, in-line comments).
